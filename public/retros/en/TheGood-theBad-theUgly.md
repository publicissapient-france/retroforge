# 🤠 Retrospective: The Good, the Bad & the Ugly

## 🏷️ Tags
Fun, Process

## 🕰️ When to use it?
When the team needs a simple and direct method to identify key points from the last sprint. Ideal for a quick and structured status check: what worked well, what went wrong, and what must absolutely change.

## 📋 Practical information

- **Duration**: 1 hour  
- **Format**: Remote / In-person  
- **Difficulty level**: 🌶️ (1 chili)  
- **Number of participants**: 3 to 10  
- **Required tools**:
  - Whiteboard (physical or virtual)
  - Post-its or collaborative board tool (Miro, MURAL, Klaxoon)
  - Optional simple voting system

## ⚠️ Main risks
- **Perceived as too simplistic**  
  💡 *Solution*: Ask open questions and encourage nuance.

- **Overly negative atmosphere**  
  💡 *Solution*: Start with the “Good” to build a positive tone.

- **“Ugly” topics being ignored**  
  💡 *Solution*: Turn “Ugly” issues into SMART actions and assign follow-up.

- **Repetitiveness**  
  💡 *Solution*: Vary the format (drawings, metaphors, emoji voting, etc.).
