## 🏷️ Tags

## When to use it?
When the team is facing multiple persistent problems, a poor mindset, and a loss of bearings.
This retro is ideal for identifying deep risks, rebuilding team vision, and freeing speech, sometimes with dark humor.

## 📋 Practical information
- **Duration**: 1h30
- **Format**: Remote ideally
- **Difficulty level**: 🌶️🌶️🌶️ (3 chilies)
- **Number of participants**: Up to 12
- **Required tools**: Miro / Mural, Teams (with rooms)

# 🧭 Step-by-step navigation

## ✅ Preparation phase
- Create a board with 4 spaces:

  - Apocalypse Summit
  - The Fall
- Prepare subgroup rooms for pairs (Teams or Zoom).
- Remind in intro that dark humor is used as a tool for defusing tension, but benevolence remains the absolute rule.

## ⏱️ Detailed agenda

### 🕵️‍♀️ Step 1: Dark Manifesto – Solo mode (10 min)
**Objective**: Identify the worst possible behaviors or decisions.
Each participant lists everything that would lead to sprint or PI failure.
Examples (absurd or provocative):
- "Stop talking to anyone"
- "Deploy to production without testing"
- "Kidnap the QA"

💬 The facilitator groups these ideas by theme for the next steps.

### 🔥 Step 2: The Infernal Trio – Duo mode (20 min)
**Objective**: Create the ultimate failure plan.
In pairs, participants select:
- **Internal risks** – 3 actions (e.g., poor communication, poor ticket distribution, multitasking).
- **External risks** – 3 actions (e.g., scope changes, team turnover).

🎤 Each pair presents their "destructive plan", then collective vote to elect the worst.

### ⚡ Step 3: The Apocalypse Summit – Fast & Furious mode (5 min)
**Objective**: Prioritize risks on an Impact × Probability matrix.
Categories:
- 💥 Biggest Risks: High impact, high probability
- ❄️ Thin Ice: High impact, low probability
- 😠 Annoyances: Low impact, high probability
- 😴 Minor Worries: Low impact, low probability

🧷 Fast and Furious mode: everyone can move post-its until reaching consensus.

### 🛠️ Step 4: The Fall – Action plan (25 min)
**Objective**: Transform chaos into concrete actions.
Fictional context: The CEO has forbidden destruction → must propose a remediation plan.

From priority risks:
- Identify **SMART actions**
- Assign **owners** and **deadlines**

💡 Examples:
- "Clarify backlog at sprint start"
- "Set up an asynchronous daily"

## 🎯 Actions & Outputs

- ✅ **Concrete actions** with assigned owners
- 🧭 A clear vision of what would jeopardize the project... and how to avoid it

# 🎁 Our little extra tip
- Give each group a **chaos cult name** to spice up the atmosphere
- Reward the **most creative "destructive plan"** with a trophy (real or virtual)
- Replay this retro in **3 sprints** to measure the evolution of treated risks
