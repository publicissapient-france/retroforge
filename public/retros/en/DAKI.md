## 🎯 When to use it?

- Perfect for **taking a step back** after one or several sprints.
- Helps analyze the **evolution of practices** in a tension-free way.

## 📋 Practical information
- **Duration**: 1h to 1h30

## ⏱️ Detailed agenda

### Phase 1: Introduction (5 min)
- Present the session’s objective.
- Emphasize the importance of **factual and positive contributions**.

### Phase 2: Individual reflection (5–10 min)
- Each participant fills in Post-its privately.

### Phase 3: Sharing and grouping (10–15 min)
- Participants stick their ideas in the appropriate columns.
- Quick explanation of each Post-it.
- Facilitator groups similar ideas by theme.

### Phase 4: Discussion and action plan (30–35 min)
- Two approaches:
  - **Dot voting** to prioritize topics.
  - Directly choose the theme with the most Post-its.
- Jointly define **SMART actions** (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, Time-bound).
- Assign **owners** and **deadlines**.

## 🎯 Actions & Outputs

# 🎁 Our little extra tip
- Add a **metaphorical touch**: imagine the retro as a **garden**:
  - We **pull out** (Drop),
  - We **plant** (Add),
  - We **water** (Improve),
  - And we **maintain** (Keep).
- Invite each member to **personally commit** to one action from “Add” or “Improve” to strengthen ownership.
