# 🧬 Retrospective: The Life Line

## 🏷️ Tags
Vision, Process, Mood

## 🕰️ When to use it?
- When the team is going through a **low-energy period** or facing **unproductive sprints**.
- Ideal for **stepping back over several sprints**, sharing personal experiences, and identifying **mobilizable resources**.
- Gives everyone a chance to **tell “their version”** of the story, based on past successes and struggles.

## 📋 Practical information
- **Duration**: 1h30  
- **Format**: Remote or In-person  
- **Difficulty level**: 🌶️🌶️🌶️ (3 chilies)  
- **Number of participants**: 4 to 8  
- **Required tools**:
  - Physical or virtual whiteboard (Miro, Mural, FigJam…)  
  - Markers / Post-its  
  - A pre-drawn timeline

## ⚠️ Main risks
- **Too much focus on the "downs"**: can anchor the team in negativity.  
  💡 *Solution*: Always highlight the "ups" to create a constructive space.
- **Uneven participation**: some may hesitate to share their experiences.  
  💡 *Solution*: Foster a caring environment, encourage discussion, help recall shared moments.
- **Time overrun**: long discussions can limit actionable outcomes.  
  💡 *Solution*: Stick to strict time limits for each phase and speaker.

## ⏱️ Detailed agenda

### Phase 1 – Setting the context (2 min)  
Explain that everyone will share their view of the past sprint. All perceptions are valid.

### Phase 2 – Format explanation (2 min)  
Each participant draws their **experience curve** on the timeline (sinusoidal), marking:
- The "ups" with **successes, good moments** (post-its)
- The "downs" with **difficulties, failures** (post-its)

### Phase 3 – Drawing individual curves (25 min)  
~3 minutes per person to present their curve and explain key events.

### Phase 4 – Focus on ups (15 min)  
Discussion about shared positive moments.  
Guiding questions:
- What did we do well?  
- What was our mindset?  
- Why did we succeed?  
- What qualities did we use?

### Phase 5 – Structuring resources (5 min)  
Summarize the qualities/resources linked to the successes.

### Phase 6 – Reflect on a shared down (10 min)  
Choose a common low point and discuss:
- Could we have avoided it by using our positive resources?  
- What prevented us from doing so?  
- How can we make sure to activate these strengths next time?

### Phase 7 – Closing (2 min)  
Conduct a quick **ROTI** or hot feedback round to end the session.

# 🎁 Our little extra tip

- Invite participants to **name their curve** — this boosts emotional anchoring and memory.
