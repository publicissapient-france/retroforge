## 🏷️ Tags
Vision, Mood

## 🕰️ When to use it?
This retrospective aims to improve communication and understanding of roles within the team by allowing each member to step into someone else's shoes.
It's particularly useful when **misunderstandings** or **frustrations** arise due to a **lack of knowledge about responsibilities** and expectations of other roles.

## 📋 Practical information
- **Duration**: 1h50
- **Format**: Remote / In-person
- **Difficulty level**: 🌶️🌶️🌶️ (3 chilies)
- **Number of participants**: 5 to 10
- **Required tools**:
  - Physical or virtual whiteboard
  - Post-its or digital equivalent
  - Video conferencing tool (if remote)

## ⚠️ Main risks

- **Sensitivity of the topic**: Discussions about roles can generate tension.
  💡 *Solution*: Set a benevolent framework from the start, remind respect rules.

- **Frustration or misunderstanding**: Some members may feel misunderstood.
  💡 *Solution*: Promote active listening, rephrase to clarify.

- **Exercise too abstract**: Difficult to step into someone else's shoes.
  💡 *Solution*: Encourage **concrete** feedback based on team's daily life.

# 🎁 Our little extra tip

- Repeat the workshop **every 3 to 6 months**, especially during team changes.
- Ask everyone to write:
  > "What I wish others knew about my role"
  👉 This often quickly releases tensions.
- If clarification is needed: use a **Give & Take matrix**.
