# 🧠 Retrospective: Starfish – To the star(fish) and beyond

## 🏷️ Tags
Conflicts, Mood, Sprint, Process

## 🎯 When to use it?
- When retrospectives become **routine** or **monotonous**.
- When it's necessary to **examine multiple aspects** of the sprint: processes, tools, interactions.
- To **stimulate active participation** and **structure feedback** more thoroughly.

## 📋 Practical information
- **Duration**: 1h30
- **Format**: Remote or In-person
- **Difficulty level**: 🌶️🌶️ (2 chilies – moderate)
- **Number of participants**: 5 to 10
- **Required tools**:
  - Physical or virtual whiteboard
  - Collaborative tool (Miro, MURAL, etc.)
  - Post-its in various colors

## ⚠️ Main risks
- **Superficiality**: Encourage participants to dig deeper into their ideas.
- **Imbalance**: Risk of neglecting some categories if not properly facilitated.

# 🧭 Step-by-step navigation

## ✅ Preparation phase
- Create a board with 5 colored columns:
  - **Continue** (turquoise): What works and should be kept.
  - **More of** (green): What works and could be amplified.
  - **Less of** (yellow): What works but should be reduced.
  - **Stop** (red/pink): What doesn’t work and should be discontinued.
  - **Start** (blue): New actions or experiments to try.

- **Display** the definitions under or near the column headers.
- **Prepare** an additional board for prioritizing topics/actions.
- **Create a psychologically safe space**:
  - Remind everyone of kind and constructive communication rules (NVC, OSBD).
  - Use an **icebreaker** to gauge everyone’s mood.
