# 🧠 Retrospective: Speed Boat

## 🏷️ Tags
Vision, Innovation

## 🎯 When to use it?
- When the team has encountered **blockages** and the sprint has been difficult.
- When there's a **significant gap** between planned and delivered.
- To **identify brakes and accelerators** and better prepare future sprints.
- Ideal with a **new team** that's starting.

## 📋 Practical information
- **Duration**: 1h to 1h30
- **Format**: Remote or In-person
- **Difficulty level**: 🌶️🌶️ (2 chilies)
- **Number of participants**: 4 to 8
- **Required tools**:
  - In-person: Whiteboard and post-its
  - Remote: Miro, Mural or any other collaborative tool with custom visual support

## ⚠️ Main risks
- ⚠️ **Difficulty prioritizing** if too many problems are raised: risk of dispersion.
- ⚠️ **Too many post-its**: Set a post-it limit to stay efficient.

# 🧭 Step-by-step navigation

## ✅ Preparation phase
Create a **visual support** with:
- 🛥️ **Boat**: represents the team or sprint.
- 🏝️ **Island**: goals or vision to achieve.
- 💨 **Wind**: what pushes the team forward.
- ⚓ **Anchor**: what slows down or blocks the team.
- 🪨 **Rocks**: future risks or obstacles.
- ☀️ **Sun**: what was appreciated, positive moments.
- 💌 **Postcard**: synthesis of actions for the future.

## ⏱️ Detailed agenda

### Phase 1: Filling categories (10 min)
- Each participant writes **maximum 3 post-its per category** (winds, anchors, risks, etc.).
- Posting on the visual support.

### Phase 2: Presentation and discussion (30-40 min)
- Each member explains their post-its.
- The facilitator **groups** and **prioritizes** similar ideas.

### Phase 3: Action definition (20 min)
- **Option 1**: Dot voting to prioritize themes to address.
- **Option 2**: Take directly the themes with the most post-its.
- Define **SMART actions** to lift anchors, avoid rocks, and strengthen winds.
- Complete the **postcard** 💌 with validated actions.

## 🎯 Actions & Outputs
- A **clear list of risks** and improvement levers for future sprints.
- A **transparent exchange** about current and future situation.
- **Collective commitment** around decided solutions.

# 🎁 Our little extra tip
- Suggest writing the **postcard** as a **message to the future team**.
- **Illustrate** the visual support to make the session more engaging.
- **Adapt the metaphor**: if the team prefers, you can use a **speed car** or any other fast vehicle instead of the boat.
- Limit post-its to avoid dispersion (example: maximum 3 post-its per category).
