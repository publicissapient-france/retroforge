# 🧠 Retrospective: Dixit

## 🏷️ Tags
Fun, Mood, Vision

## 🎯 When to use it?
Perfect for surfacing feelings, unspoken thoughts, and better understanding how everyone perceives sprint events.
Useful if you feel the team tends to interpret instead of expressing themselves clearly.

## 📋 Practical information
- **Duration**: 1h30
- **Format**: Remote or In-person
- **Difficulty level**: 🌶️🌶️🌶️ (3 chilies)
- **Number of participants**: Up to 10 (Scrum team)
- **Required tools**:
  - Dixit cards (physical or digital)
  - Board or collaborative space (Miro, Mural, etc.)

## ⚠️ Main risks
- Some participants may try to find meaning at all costs in abstract images.
- The facilitator must be rigorous in taking notes and grouping topics without being overwhelmed.

💡 **Tip**: Remind everyone that this is above all a moment for listening and sharing, not about finding the "right interpretation".
