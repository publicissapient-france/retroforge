# 💌 Retrospective: The Future Postcard

## 🏷️ Tags
Vision, Innovation

## 🕰️ When to use it?
- Perfect for starting a **new project**, a **new phase**, a **year**, or a **PI**.
- Promotes a **positive (or lucid) projection** into the future to **align the team on expectations and ambitions**.
- Useful for identifying upfront the **success conditions** or **potential pitfalls**.

## 📋 Practical information
- **Duration**: 1h to 1h30
- **Format**: Remote or In-person
- **Difficulty level**: 🌶️ (1 chili)
- **Number of participants**: Scrum team or more (up to 12-14 participants)
- **Required tools**:
  - Miro / Mural
  - Post-its or digital text area
  - Postcard sharing board

## ⚠️ Main risks
- **Superficial projections**: some participants write vague or unengaging wishes.
  💡 *Solution*: encourage including observable facts, specific events, measurable results.
- **Too pessimistic projections**: can generate negative dynamics.
  💡 *Solution*: accompany the feedback with a search for improvement levers.
- **Lack of postcard exploitation**: the exercise loses its value if not used.
  💡 *Solution*: take time to synthesize and extract actions.

# 🧭 Step-by-step navigation

## ⏱️ Detailed agenda

### Phase 1 – Introduction (5 min)

- Feelings

### Phase 3 – Collective sharing (10-15 min)
- Each participant reads their postcard.
- The facilitator **notes recurring or striking ideas** on a board.

### Phase 4 – Grouping and reflection (10-15 min)
- **Synthesis of success levers** and **failure risks** mentioned.
- Discussion on the **necessary conditions** to achieve successes or avoid failures.

### Phase 5 – Co-construction of actions (10-20 min)
- Identify **concrete actions** or **team commitments**.
- Integrate actions into **Jira** or any other management tool if needed.
