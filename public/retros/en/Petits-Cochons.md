# 🐷 Retrospective: The Three Little Pigs

## 🏷️ Tags
Fun, Process

## 🎯 When to use it?
- When the team wants to **assess the strength** of its practices.
- In case of **doubts** about current methods, even if the sprint seemed fine.
- To **highlight successes** while identifying areas for improvement.

## 📋 Practical information
- **Duration**: 1h to 1h30
- **Format**: Remote or In-person
- **Difficulty level**: 🌶️ (1 chili)
- **Number of participants**: Up to 10 (Scrum team)
- **Required tools**:
  - Physical whiteboard or Miro, Mural, FigJam…
  - Physical or digital Post-its

## ⚠️ Main risks
- ⚠️ The team may **focus only on flaws**, ignoring what works well.  
  → The facilitator should **encourage acknowledgment of successes**.
- ⚠️ Risk of **poorly formulated feedback**: watch the tone and wording.

# 🧭 Step-by-step navigation

## ✅ Preparation phase
- Set up a board with 3 columns:
  - 🟡 **Straw House**: Fragile practices, likely to collapse.
  - 🟠 **Wood House**: Fairly solid practices, but still improvable.
  - 🧱 **Brick House**: Strong, well-established practices.

## ⏱️ Detailed agenda

### Phase 1: Introduction (5 min)
- Present the fairy tale metaphor.
- Explain that each house represents a **level of practice solidity**.
- Clarify the goal: to **recognize, improve, or reconsider** certain practices.

### Phase 2: Individual reflection (5–10 min)
- Each participant writes their ideas privately.

### Phase 3: Sharing and categorization (10–15 min)
- Participants place Post-its in the appropriate column.
- Quick explanation of each choice.
- Facilitator groups similar Post-its under common themes.

### Phase 4: Discussion and prioritization (30–35 min)
- Identify which practices to **reinforce, drop, or strengthen**.
- Selection methods:
  - Dot voting on themes to discuss.
  - Or choose the theme with the most Post-its.
- For each selected theme, define **SMART actions**.

---

## 🎯 Actions & Outputs
- A **concrete list of actions** to improve or reinforce existing processes.
- Better **awareness of already successful practices**.
- A sense of **team recognition** for what works well.

# 🎁 Our little extra tip
- Include the **wolf** 🐺 in the workshop: it symbolizes **threats or risks** hovering over fragile practices.
- Suggest **repeating the retro a few sprints later** to see how the “houses” evolved.
- Add strong visuals to reinforce the metaphor (drawings, house icons, etc.).
