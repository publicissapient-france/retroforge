- To **share feelings** and **formalize learnings**.
- Helps better understand what was **missing** and what the team **wishes for the future**.

## 📋 Practical information

- **Difficulty level**: 🌶️ (1 chili)

- **Required tools**:
  - No specific tools required

# 💡 Our little extra tip
- Encourage the use of **metaphors or analogies** (e.g., "We were flying blind", "The engine stalled").
- Always start with **LIKED** to avoid bringing down the mood.
- Do the 4L **as a facilitator** too: show an example of transparency and commitment.
